Also thanks to the on-line shop [Gooze](http://www.gooze.eu) for providing the testing tokens.

**Note on November 2011**
The development slowed down a bit as we are currently working on a SaaS solution called [SecurePass](http://www.secure-pass.ent). This service has a [special program](http://www.secure-pass.net/wiki/index.php/SpecialProgram) that give _free users_ to open source projects, school and universities and it's fully compatible with TOTP tokens. We do apologize for any inconvenience.
